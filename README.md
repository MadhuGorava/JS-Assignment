# JavaScript User List Application

This is a JavaScript application that performs various operations on two lists of users.

## User Lists

There are two input lists, `List1` and `List2`, each containing usernames:

```javascript
const List1 = ['Arjun', 'Adwait', 'Swapnil', 'Amit', 'Vishal', 'Adnan'];
const List2 = ['Adwait', 'Laxman', 'Amit', 'Adnan', 'Nitin', 'Gaurav'];
**Operations**
The application provides the following functionalities:

**a. Get a unique set of users from List1 which are not in List2**

**b. Get a unique set of users from List2 which are not in List1**
**c. Get a set of users who are present in List1 and List2 both (intersection of List1 & List2)**
